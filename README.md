### Project Purpose

This code refactoring was done to clean up the existing code of Horiseon's homepage and make it easier for future devs maintaining the website to find, edit, or optimize aspects of the page design. 

### The following changes were made to the html index and css stylesheet:
* Head / title corrected to name of company
* Images provided with alt attributes
* Missing anchor links added
* Non-semantic html elements replaced with semantic html elements
* Empty alt tags added to decorative images so that screen readers say nothing and move to next image
* CSS stylesheet classes consolidated or removed where redundant
